The Gomoku Program Algorithm Explanation

Gomoku is a 2-player strategy board game with 15 by 15 table.
In order to win, a player must mark exactly 5 consecutive spaces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
A player may not win if 6 or more consecutive spaces are marked.

Program's Algorithm:
program's mark : X, player's mark: O, empty: +
! : O or +, @ : X or +
"my" is "program's", "his" is "player's"

Steps to check in order:

1.) Check for my bingo in a turn. XXXX+ or XXX+X or XX+XX or !X+X+X+X!
2.) Check for his bingo in a turn. OOOO+ or OOO+O or OO+OO or @O+O+O+O@
3.) Check for my checkBingoIn2Turns moves if possible (only do 2nd one for first few turns):
    XX+X or         X       or        +      or +XXX+
                  X + X               X
                    +             + X + X +
                                      X
                                      +

    Except for +XXX+ and 2nd one, place mark on the center.
    Note: Although 2nd one is not really bingo in 2 turns,
    if not blocked, I'll lose by diagnal attacks with 3 by 3 attacks at the beginning.
4.) Check for his checkBingoIn2Turns moves.
    They are same as listed above (but reverse O and X).
    Except for +XXX+, block the center.
    They must be stopped right away unless conditions above can be made.
5.) Check for my checkBingoIn3Turns moves if possible:
    OXXX+ or OXX+XX+ or OXX+X+ or OX+XX+ (reverse of prev.) or      O
                                                                    X
                                                                + X + X +
                                                                    X
                                                                    +

    Except for the last one, do not place mark on center to not make it look too obvious.
    Although vulnerable to be blocked, it is better to have more marks this way.
6.) Check for his checkBingoIn3Turns.
    They are same as listed above (but reverse O and X).
    Except for OXXX+, block the center.
    They must be stopped unless conditions above can be made.
7.) Add a mark on the longest line. (1 or 2 in length + 1)
8.) First time? Mark on player's first mark's 1:30 o'clock direction right next to it.

No move can be made outside of the bounds of the 15 by 15 game board.
