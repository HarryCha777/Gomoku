# Gomoku

Gomoku is a 2-player strategy board game with 15 by 15 table.
In order to win, a player must mark exactly 5 consecutive spaces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
A player may not win if 6 or more consecutive spaces are marked.

This is a program that plays Gomoku against the player.
The player's mark is 'O', program's mark is 'X', and empty space is '+'.
The program's most recent mark is shown as 'N'.

The GIF below shows a match between a player and the program.
